# Pickly
Pickly is a basic macOS picker.  More to come?  Definitely.  SwiftUI's current macOS does not update itself when the values change.  Please feel to contribute.  I hope that the new SwiftUI versions will no longer need this.

This was taken from a solution at Stackoverflow.  We will be adding the link as soon as we find it again.
